                <h2>SABRINA YAFIET</h2>
                <p>My Name is Sabrina Yafiet. I was born in a city called Asmara in Eritrea. Am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology at International University of East Africa in uganda. My strength is my attitude that I want to take on the challenge that I can, my thinking that I accept both success and failure in a balanced way.
                  I do not like to say weaknesses but I want to say that I will not leave any questions altogether, I believe in myself and my hard work and I want fulfillment in everything.
                  My short-term goal is that I want a platform where I can increase my career and with the growth of organizations like others.
                  My long-term goal is to be the cause of the organization’s success and I want to organize as a benchmark for other organizations.
                  My moral is “I never do any harm to others”.
